# Introduction 
This document provides an overview of the East-R examples provided in this directory.  Each example is included in a directory that provides an R Studio project file, a Description file that describes the example,  RCode folder which contains the example R scripts, FillInTheBlinakRCode are the worked examples with various code deleted so the user can practice and fill in the blanks. 

The following examples are included:

## Patient Simulation 

1. **[Two Arm, Normal Outcome - Patient Outcome Simulation Examples](2ArmNormalOutcomePatientSimulationDescription.html)**
The following examples demonstrate how to add new patient outcome simulation capabilities into East using an R function in the context of a two-arm trial with a normally distributed patient outcome. For all examples, we assume the trial design consists of standard of care and an experimental treatment and the trial design assumes patient outcomes are normally distributed.
1. **2-Arm, Binary Outcome, Patient Simulation**: These examples demonstrates how to add new patient outcome simulation functionality into East using an R function in the context of a two-arm trial with normal outcomes. For all examples, we assume the trial design consists of standard of care and an experimental treatment.  The patient outcomes are normal.  The intent of these examples is to demonstrate how to add new ways to simulate patient data using R in a variety of trial examples.        

1. **[2-Am, Time-to-Event Outcome, Patient Simulation](2ArmTimeToEventOutcomePatientSimulationDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates how to add new patient outcome simulation functionality into East using an R function.  For all examples, we assume the trial design consists of standard of care and an experimental treatment.  The patient outcomes are time-to-event.  The intent of these examples is to demonstrate how to add new ways to simulate time-to-event data using R.  

## Analysis 

1. **2-Arm, Binary Outcome Analysis**: This example demonstrates how to add new analysis functionality  into East using an R function.  For all examples, we assume the trial design consists of control and an experimental treatments. There are 2 Interim Analysis, IA, and a Final Analysis, FA. At the IA, the analysis is performed and depending on the example may determine early efficacy or early futility depending on the design.

## Treatment Selection 

1. **[Treatment Selection](TreatmentSelectionDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates a multi-arm trial with a treatment selection rule.  The examples provide additional approaches to treatment selection. 

## Advanced Example
This example provide multiple R function to achieve a more complex design option. 


1. **[Bayesian Assurance of Consecutive Studies](AssuranaceConsecutiveStudiesBayesianAssuranceUsingEastR.html) ** The intent of this example is to demonstrate the computation of Bayesian assurance, or probability of success, through the integration of East and R using a series of examples.  These examples begin with a 2-arm, normal outcome, fixed sample trial assuming a non-standard prior for computation of assurance.  The examples progress to a more complex setting of computing assurance for a sequence of a phase 2 trial with normal outcomes followed by a phase 3 trial where the outcome is time-to-event.

1. **2-Am, Time-to-Event Outcome, Sample Size Re-estimation**: This example demonstrates how to add new approaches to the SSR when using time-to-event data. For the SSR in this type of design, the number of events can be increased by the function in R.
