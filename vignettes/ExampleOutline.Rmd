## Introduction 
This document provides an overview of the R examples provided in [this directory](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/tree/main/inst/Examples). Each example is included in a directory that provides:

- an RStudio project file, 
- a Description file that describes the example, 
- an R folder which contains the example R scripts,
- optional: a FillInTheBlankR folder which contains the worked examples with various code deleted so you can practice and fill in the blanks. 

The following examples are included:

## Patient Simulation 

1. **[2-Arm, Normal Outcome - Patient Simulation](2ArmNormalOutcomePatientSimulationDescription.html)**: These examples demonstrate how to add new patient outcome simulation capabilities into East Horizon using an R function in the context of a two-arm trial with a normally distributed patient outcome.

1. **[2-Arm, Time-To-Event Outcome - Patient Simulation](2ArmTimeToEventOutcomePatientSimulationDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates how to add new patient outcome simulation functionality into East Horizon using an R function in the context of a two-arm trial with a time-to-event patient outcome. The intent of these examples is to demonstrate how to add new ways to simulate time-to-event data using R.  

1. **[2-Arm, Binary Outcome - Patient Simulation](2ArmBinaryOutcomePatientSimulation.html)**: These examples demonstrate how to add new patient outcome simulation functionality into East Horizon using an R function in the context of a two-arm trial with binary outcomes. The intent of these examples is to demonstrate how to add new ways to simulate patient data using R in a variety of trial examples.

1. **[2-Arm, Normal Outcome, Repeated Measures - Patient Simulation](2ArmNormalRepeatedMeasuresResponseGeneration.html)**: Repeated measures involve collecting multiple data points for the same variable from the same subjects across multiple time periods. This example illustrates how to integrate new patient outcome simulation capabilities into East Horizon using R functions in the context of a two-arm trial with repeated measures (continuous outcome).

1. **[Childhood Anxiety Trial](ChildhoodAnxiety.html)**: This example covers a specific situation where the patient data simulation needs to be customized to match what is expected in a clinical trial in childhood anxiety.

## Analysis 

1. **[2-Arm, Normal Outcome - Analysis](2ArmNormalOutcomeAnalysisDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates how to add new analysis functionality for normal data into East Horizon using an R function.

1. **[2-Arm, Time-To-Event Outcome - Analysis](2ArmTimeToEventOutcomeAnalysisDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates how to add new analysis functionality for time-to-event data into East Horizon using an R function.

1. **[2-Arm, Binary Outcome - Analysis](2ArmBinaryOutcomeAnalysisDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates how to add new analysis functionality for binary data into East Horizon using an R function.

1. **[Time-To-Event Weighted Conditional Power Futility Analysis](TimeToEventConditionalPowerFutilityAnalysis.html)**: This example demonstrates how to perform a time-to-event (TTE) analysis with conditional power and futility boundaries based on the logrank test.

## Other Integration Points

These examples use other integration points.

1. **[Treatment Selection](TreatmentSelectionDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates a multi-arm trial with a treatment selection rule and binary outcome. Different examples provide additional approaches to treatment selection. 

1. **[Poisson Arrival Times](GeneratePoissonArrival.html)**: This example demonstrates how to add the ability to generate patient arrival time according to a Poisson process with a ramp-up. Different examples provide different approaches for simulating arrival time according to a Poisson process. 

1. **[Patient Dropout](PatientDropout.html)**: These examples illustrate how to customize the dropout distribution in East Horizon using R functions.

1. **[Patient Randomization](PatientRandomization.html)**: These examples illustrate how to customize how subjects are assigned to designated arms in East Horizon using R functions.

## Advanced Examples

These examples use more than one integration points in the same project to achieve a more complex design option.

1. **[Bayesian Assurance, Continuous Outcome](BayesianAssuranceContinuous.html)**: This example demonstrates the computation of Bayesian assurance, or probability of success, using a mixture of normal distributions prior featuring a two-arm trial with normally distributed outcomes.

1. **[Bayesian Assurance, Time-to-Event Outcome](BayesianAssuranceTimeToEvent.html)**: This example demonstrates the computation of Bayesian assurance, or probability of success, using a bi-modal distribution prior featuring a two-arm trial with time-to-event outcomes.

1. **[Consecutive Studies, Continuous Outcome](ConsecutiveStudiesContinuous.html)**: This example demonstrates the computation of Bayesian assurance, or probability of success, in consecutive studies: a Phase 2 trial followed by a Phase 3 trial, both with normal outcomes. The objective is to understand how conducting a Phase 2 study can reduce the risk associated with the Phase 3 trial.

1. **[Consecutive Studies, Continuous & Time-to-Event Outcomes](ConsecutiveStudiesContinuousTimeToEvent.html)**: This example demonstrates the computation of Bayesian assurance, or probability of success, in consecutive studies: a Phase 2 trial with normal outcomes followed by a Phase 3 trial with time-to-event outcomes. The objective is to understand how conducting a Phase 2 study can reduce the risk associated with the Phase 3 trial. This example also include a step to load the Phase 2 output and extract the true treatment differences.

1. **[Consecutive Studies, Binary Outcome](ConsecutiveStudiesBinary.html)**: This example demonstrates the computation of conditional probability of success in consecutive studies. It features a sequential design involving a Phase 2 trial followed by a Phase 3 trial, both with a binary endpoint. We show how Phase 2 results are saved and then used as the prior for Phase 3, allowing the Phase 3 patient outcomes to be generated conditional on Phase 2 success.

1. **[Probability of Success, Dual Endpoints](ProbabilitySuccessDualEndpoints.html)**: This example demonstrates how to compute the probability of success of a trial and extend East Horizon's single-endpoint framework to handle dual endpoints (Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival) using custom R scripts for the Analysis and Response integration points.

1. **[Multiple Endpoints With Covariates and Stratified Randomization](MultipleEndpointsWithCovariates.html)**: These examples demonstrate how to integrate continuous patient outcome simulation and analysis functionality into East Horizon using custom R functions. All examples simulate multiple independent, continuous outcomes drawn from normal distributions. Examples 2 and 3 additionally incorporate binary covariates with user-defined probabilities and effect sizes. Example 3 further extends the simulation by implementing stratified randomization based on these covariates, showcasing how patient allocation can be customized beyond East Horizonâ€™s native features.
