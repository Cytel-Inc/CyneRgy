# Introduction 
This document provides an overview of the East-R examples provided in this directory.  Each example is included in a directory that provides an R Studio project file, a Description file that describes the example,  RCode folder which contains the example R scripts, FillInTheBlinakRCode are the worked examples with various code deleted so the user can practice and fill in the blanks. 

The following examples are included:

1. **2-Arm, Binary Outcome Analysis**: This example demonstrates how to add new analysis functionality  into East using an R function.  For all examples, we assume the trial design consist of control and an experimental treatments. There are 2 Interim Analysis, IA, and a Final Analysis, FA. At the IA, the analysis is performed and depending on the example may determine early efficacy or early futility depending on the design.

1. **[2-Arm, Normal Outcome, Patient Simulation](2ArmNormalOutcomePatientSimulation/Description.html)**: These example demonstrates how to add new patient outcome simulation functionality into East using an R function in the context of a two-arm trial with normal outcomes. For all examples, we assume the trial design consists of standard of care and an experimental treatment.  The patient outcomes are normal.  The intent of these examples is to demonstrate how to add new ways to simulate patient data using R in a variety of trial examples.        

1. **2-Am, Time-to-Event Outcome, Patient Simulation**: This example demonstrates how to add new patient outcome simulation functionality into East using an R function.  For all examples, we assume the trial design consists of standard of care and an experimental treatment.  The patient outcomes are time-to-event.  The intent of these examples is to demonstrate how to add new ways to simulate time-to-event data using R.  

1. **2-Am, Time-to-Event Outcome, Sample Size Re-estimation**: This example demonstrates how to add new approaches to the SSR when using time-to-event data. For the SSR in this type of design, the number of events can be increased by the function in R.

1. **[Treatment Selection](TreatmentSelection/TreatmentSelectionDescription.html)**: This example demonstrates a multi-arm trial with a treatment selection rule.  The examples provide additional approaches to treatment selection.
