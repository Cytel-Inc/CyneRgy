# Study Objectives

The input variables, expected output variables, examples, and templates for this integration point depend on the study objective (number of arms) you are using. Refer to the relevant pages below:

1. [**Two Arm Confirmatory**](IntegrationPointDropoutContinuousOrBinaryTwoArm.html)
1. [**Multiple Arm Confirmatory**](IntegrationPointDropoutContinuousOrBinaryMultipleArm.html)

Please note that R integration with the Multiple Arm Confirmatory study objective is not currently available in East Horizon Explore, but it is expected to be added in a future update.
