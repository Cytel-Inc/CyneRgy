# Variables of SimData

The variables in SimData are generated during data generation, and depend on the current simulation. Some common and useful variables are:

|**Variable**|**Type**|**Description**|**Availability (East Horizon Explore)**|**Availability (East Horizon Design)**|**Other availability conditions**|
|------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
|**SimData\$ArrivalTime**|Vector of Numeric| Vector of length equal to the number of subjects, containing the generated arrival times for all subjects.|
|**SimData\$TreatmentID**|Vector of Integer| Vector of length equal to the number of subjects, containing the allocation indices for all subjects:<br>– `0`: Control arm.<br>– `1`: First experimental arm.<br>– etc.|
|**SimData\$Response**  | Vector of Numeric  | Vector of length equal to the number of subjects, containing the generated responses for all subjects.|
|**SimData\$CensorIndOrg**  | Vector of Integer  | Vector of length equal to the number of subjects, containing the generated censor indicator values for all subjects:<br>– `0`: Dropout.<br>– `1`: Completer.|
