# Description

The Response integration point allows you to incorporate custom patient outcome simulation capabilities into East Horizon. By specifying a function, you can simulate patient outcomes according to your requirements, replacing the native generation method for patient response. For example, you can:

- Simulate patient data using a mixture distribution where a proportion of patients do not respond to treatment.
- Simulate patient data from a statistical distribution not natively supported by East Horizon, such as:
  - Gamma distribution for continuous outcomes,
  - Beta distribution for binary outcomes,
  - Weibull distribution for time-to-event outcomes.

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Explore

You can set up a response function under **Distribution** in a **Response Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Distribution** field in the **Response Card**. For Dual Endpoints, it will be under **Response Generation Method**.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshot below:

## In East Horizon Design

You can set up a response function under **Distribution** in the **Response** section of an **Input Set** created by simulation.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Create and compute a first **analytical design input set**.
1. Navigate to the Results section and **simulate** the analytical design.
1. Navigate to the new **simulation input set** that was created.
1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Distribution** field in the **Response** tab.

1. Choose the appropriate test in the **Design** tab.
1. If you see the **Design Input** window, compute the scenario using the **Compute** button, save the design using the **Save in Workbook** button, then navigate to the **Simulation Input** window by clicking on the **Simulate Design** button under **Library**.
1. Click on the **Include Options** button on the top right corner of the **Simulation Input** window and select both **Accrual / Dropouts** and **User Defined R Function**.
1. In the tab **User Defined R Function**, a list of tasks will appear. Place your cursor in the **File Name** field for the task **Generate Response**.
1. Click on the button **Browse...** to select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
