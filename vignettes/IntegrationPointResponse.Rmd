# Description

The Response integration point allows you to incorporate custom patient outcome simulation capabilities into East Horizon. By specifying a function, you can simulate patient outcomes according to your requirements, replacing the native generation method for patient response. For example, you can:

- Simulate patient data using a mixture distribution where a proportion of patients do not respond to treatment.
- Simulate patient data from a statistical distribution not natively supported by East Horizon, such as:
  - Gamma distribution for continuous outcomes,
  - Beta distribution for binary outcomes,
  - Weibull distribution for time-to-event outcomes.

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Explore

You can set up a response function under **Distribution** in a **Response Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Distribution** field in the **Response Card**. For Dual Endpoints, it will be under **Response Generation Method**.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshot below:
