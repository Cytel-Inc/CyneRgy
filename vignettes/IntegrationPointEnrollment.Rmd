# Description

The Enrollment integration point allows you to customize the distribution of subject arrival times using a custom R script. Instead of relying on a default uniform distribution, you can implement alternative enrollment patterns such as Poisson, equidistant, or exponential enrollment, among others, to better suit your trial's requirements.

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Explore

You can set up an enrollment function under **Distribution** in a **Enrollment Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Distribution** field in the **Enrollment Card**.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshot below:

# Input Variables

When creating a custom R script, you can optionally use certain variables provided by East Horizon's or East's engine itself. These variables are automatically available and do not need to be set by the user, except for the `UserParam` variable. Refer to the table below for the variable that is available for this integration point.

| **Variable**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**NumSub**|Integer|Number of subjects in the trial.|
|**NumPrd**|Integer|Number of accrual periods in the trial.|
|**PrdStart**|Vector of Numeric|Vector of length `NumPrd`, indicating the start time of each period, with `PrdStarr[ 1 ] = 0`.|
|**AccrRate**|Vector of Numeric|Vector of length `NumPrd`, indicating the accrual rate of each period.|
| **UserParam**  | List     | Contains all user-defined parameters specified in East Horizon's or East's interface (refer to the [Instructions](#instructions) section). To access these parameters in your R code, use the syntax: `UserParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate parameter name. |

# Expected Output Variable

East Horizon expects an output of a specific type. Refer to the table below for the expected output for this integration point:

| **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List  | A named list containing `ArrivalTime` and `ErrorCode`.                    |

## Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ArrivalTime**   | Vector of Double  | Vector of length `NumSub`, containing the generated arrival time for all subjects.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>‚Äì `0`: No error.<br> ‚Äì `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>‚Äì `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

# Minimal Template

Your R script could contain a function such as this one, with a name of your choice. All input variables must be declared, even if they are not used in the script. We recommend always declaring `UserParam` as a default `NULL` value in the function arguments, as this will ensure that the same function will work regardless of whether the user has specified any custom parameters in the interface.

```
GenArrTimes <- function( NumSub, NumPrd, PrdStart, AccrRate, UserParam = NULL )
{
  nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
  vPatientArrivalTime 	<- rep( 0, NumSub ) # Initializing arrival time array to 0
  
  # Write the actual code here.
  # Store the generated arrival times in a vector called vPatientArrivalTime.

  return( list( ArrivalTime = as.double( vPatientArrivalTime ), ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```
