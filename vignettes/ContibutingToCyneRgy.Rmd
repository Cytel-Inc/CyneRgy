# Package Development

This document is intended to help with development of this package.  In this document you can find packages that are helpful, example code snippets and function calls that were made to create new functions. 

## Style Guide 

Please follow the [Biopharm Soft style guide](https://biopharmsoftgrp.github.io/BioPharmSoftRStyleGuide/) when developing code so that the style is consistent across different developers. 

## Helpful packages
1. [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_home.html) - Package used to create the package website. 
2. [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) Useful for creating and testing R packages
3. [covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/) - Use to create a test coverage report with the following commands
 ```
usethis::use_coverage()  # Likely you do not need to run this again as it was set up already
covr::package_coverage() # Computes the coverage
covr::report()           # Create a report
```

## Helpful Code Snippets
If you need help please ask Kyle Wathen or another team member

Add code snippet by Clicking Tools-> Global Options -> Code-> Edit Snippets.  In the Snippets menu choose R.  When creating new snippets the key work snippet should start in column 1 and the snippets should be indented.  In order to insert a snippet in R Studio you type the snippet name, or partial name, and click the tab key. 


Snippet to insert a new comment (newcom) will insert a commented code block.

 ```
snippet newcom
    `r paste( paste( rep( "#", 100), collapse="" ), "." )`
    # ${0} ####
     `r paste( paste( rep( "#", 100), collapse="" ), "." )`
```

Snippet to insert a header (header).

```
snippet header
   `r paste( paste( rep( "#", 100), collapse="" ), "." )`
   #   Program/Function Name: ${1}
