# Input Variables

When creating a custom R script, you can optionally use specific variables provided by East Horizon's engine itself. These variables are automatically available and do not need to be set by the user, except for the `UserParam` variable. Refer to the table below for the variables that are available for this integration point, outcome, and study objective.

| **Variable**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**SimData**|Data Frame|Subject data generated in current simulation, one row per subject. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `SimData$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**DesignParam**|List|Input parameters which may be needed to compute test statistics and perform tests. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `DesignParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**LookInfo**|List|Input parameters related to multiple looks. Empty when `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`, but still mandatory in the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision`. See below for more information.|
|**AdaptInfo**|List|Input parameters related to sample size re-estimation. See below for more information. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
| **UserParam**  | List     | Contains all user-defined parameters specified in the East Horizon interface (refer to the [Instructions](IntegrationPointAnalysis.html#instructions) section). To access these parameters in your R code, use the syntax: `UserParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate parameter name. |

# Expected Output Variable

East Horizon expects an output of a specific type. Refer to the table below for the expected output for this integration point:

| **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List  | A named list containing `ErrorCode` and one or multiple of the following members: `Decision`, `AnalysisTime`, `TestStat`, `Delta`, `CtrlCompleters`, `TrmtCompleters`, `CtrlPi`, `StdError`, `ReEstEvents`, `ReEstCompleters`. See below for more information.|

The output list can take different forms.

## For `Study Objective = Two Arm Confirmatory`

### Option 1 (Decision): Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decision**   | Integer  | Boundary crossing decision:<br>– `0`: No boundary crossed.<br>– `1`: Lower efficacy boundary crossed.<br>– `2`: Upper efficacy boundary crossed.<br>– `3`: Futility boundary crossed (only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`).<br>– `4`: Equivalence boundary crossed (not available in East Horizon Explore).<br>You can use the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision` to get the decision value. See the template below for the correct usage.|
|**AnalysisTime**|Numeric|Optional. Estimate of analysis time. For interim analyses, equivalent to look time; for final analysis, equivalent to study duration.|
|**ReEstCompleters**|Integer|Re-estimated number of completers. Only required for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>– `0`: No error.<br> – `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>– `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

**Note for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`**: When there is no efficacy boundary to be crossed, the return code of `0` stands for futility in the final look. Similarly, when there is no futility boundary to be crossed, the return code of `0` stands for efficacy in the final look. Use the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision` to get decision values in a simple way.

**Note for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`**: *ReEstCompleters* is required. Only Option 1 is supported, all other output options are not available.

### Option 2 (TestStat): Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TestStat**   | Numeric  | Value of appropriate test statistic on Wald ﴾Z﴿ scale.|
|**Delta**|Numeric|Estimate of Delta. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 2 or 3` (futility boundary scale is Delta or conditional power) or `Promising Zone Scale = Conditional Power - Estimated`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**CtrlCompleters**|Numeric|Number of completers for control arm. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power) and `Conditional power Delta option = Estimated Delta / Estimated HR`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**TrmtCompleters**|Numeric|Number of completers for treatment arm. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power) and `Conditional power Delta option = Estimated Delta / Estimated HR`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**CtrlPi**|Numeric|Proportion for control arm. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power) and `Conditional power Delta option = Estimated Delta / Estimated HR`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**StdError**|Numeric|Standard error of estimate of Delta.|Required if `Promising Zone Scale = Conditional Power - Estimated`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**AnalysisTime**|Numeric|Optional. Estimate of analysis time. For interim analyses, equivalent to look time; for final analysis, equivalent to study duration.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>– `0`: No error.<br> – `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>– `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

**Note for `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`**: As the design does not have any futility boundary, `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy.

**Notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`**:

- If the design does not have any futility boundary, `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy.
- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 0` (futility boundary scale is Z scale), `TestStat` will be used to check for both efficacy and futility. 
- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 2` (futility boundary scale is Delta scale), `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy and `Delta` will be used to check for futility. 
- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power scale), `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy and `Delta`, `CtrlCompleters`, `TrmtCompleters`, and `CtrlPi` will be used to check for futility.

**Notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`**:

See the notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential` above for futility and efficacy checks. Then, if `Promising Zone Scale = Conditional Power - Estimated`, `Delta` and `StdError` will be used for sample size re-estimation.


## For `Study Objective = Multiple Arm Confirmatory`

See the template below for the correct usage.|
|**AnalysisTime**|Numeric|Optional. Estimate of analysis time. For interim analyses, equivalent to look time; for final analysis, equivalent to study duration.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>– `0`: No error.<br> – `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>– `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

**Notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`**:

- Decision should take care of multiple comparison procedures adjustment appropriately.
- When there is no efficacy boundary to be crossed, the return code of `0` stands for futility in the final look. Similarly, when there is no futility boundary to be crossed, the return code of `0` stands for efficacy in the final look. Use the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision` to get decision values in a simple way.


### Option 2 (TestStat): Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |

Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>– `0`: No error.<br> – `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>– `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

**Note for `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`**: As the design does not have any futility boundary, `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy.

**Notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`**:

- If the design does not have any futility boundary, `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy.

- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 2` (futility boundary scale is Delta scale), `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy and `Delta` will be used to check for futility. 

### Option 3 (AdjPVal): Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |

# Minimal Templates

Your R script could contain a function such as these ones, with a name of your choice. All input variables must be declared, even if they are not used in the script. We recommend always declaring `UserParam` as a default `NULL` value in the function arguments, as this will ensure that the same function will work regardless of whether the user has specified any custom parameters in East Horizon.

Detailed templates with step-by-step explanations are available here: [Analyze.Continuous.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Templates/Analyze.Continuous.R) for 2-Arm, [Analyze.Continuous.SSR.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Templates/Analyze.Continuous.SSR.R) for 2-Arm with SSR, and [Analyze.Continuous.MAMS.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Templates/Analyze.Continuous.MAMS.R) for Multiple Arm.

### Minimal Template for Option 2 (TestStat)

#### For `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`

```
ComputeTestStat <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
    nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
    NumTreatments       <- DesignParam$NumTreatments
    vTestStatistic      <- rep( 0, NumTreatments )  # Initializing test statistic vector to 0	
    
	# Write the actual code here.
    # Store the computed test statistic for each treatment arm in vTestStatistic.
    
	return( list( TestStat = as.double( vTestStatistic ), ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```

#### For `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`

```
ComputeTestStat <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
    nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
    NumTreatments       <- DesignParam$NumTreatments
    vTestStatistic      <- rep( 0, NumTreatments )  # Initializing test statistic vector to 0	
    dDelta              <- 0 # Use if futility boundary scale is Delta
    
	# Write the actual code here.
    # Store the computed test statistic for each treatment arm in vTestStatistic.
    
	return( list( TestStat = as.double( vTestStatistic ),

	              ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```

### Minimal Template for Option 3 (AdjPVal)

#### For `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`

```
ComputeTestStat <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
    nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
    NumTreatments       <- DesignParam$NumTreatments
    vAdjPVal            <- rep( 0, NumTreatments )  # Initializing p-value vector to 0	
    
	# Write the actual code here.
    # Store the computed adjusted p-value for each treatment arm in vAdjPVal.
    
	return( list( AdjPVal = as.double( vTestStatistic ), ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```

#### For `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`

```
ComputeTestStat <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
    nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
    NumTreatments       <- DesignParam$NumTreatments
    vAdjPVal            <- rep( 0, NumTreatments )  # Initializing p-value vector to 0	
    dDelta              <- 0 # Use if futility boundary scale is Delta
    
	# Write the actual code here.
    # Store the computed adjusted p-value for each treatment arm in vAdjPVal.
    
	return( list( AdjPVal = as.double( vTestStatistic ),

	              ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```

### Minimal Template for Option 4 (RawPVal)

#### For `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`

```
ComputeTestStat <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
    nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
    NumTreatments       <- DesignParam$NumTreatments
    vRawPVal            <- rep( 0, NumTreatments )  # Initializing p-value vector to 0	
    
	# Write the actual code here.
    # Store the computed p-value for each treatment arm in vRawPVal.
    
	return( list( RawPVal = as.double( vTestStatistic ), ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```

#### For `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`

```
ComputeTestStat <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
    nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
    NumTreatments       <- DesignParam$NumTreatments
    vRawPVal            <- rep( 0, NumTreatments )  # Initializing p-value vector to 0
    dDelta              <- 0 # Use if futility boundary scale is Delta
    
	# Write the actual code here.
    # Store the computed p-value for each treatment arm in vRawPVal.
    
	return( list( RawPVal = as.double( vTestStatistic ),
	              Delta = as.double( dDelta ), # Include if futility boundary scale is Delta
