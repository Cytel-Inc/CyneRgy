# Description

The Analysis integration point allows you to customize the statistical test for the treatment effect using a custom R script. This flexibility enables you to implement methods that better align with your trial's specific needs, rather than relying on the built-in default statistical tests. For example:

- **Continuous outcomes**: Instead of using the default difference of means, you could provide a script for alternative approaches such as the ratio of means or a test from the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney family.
- **Binary outcomes**: Instead of the default difference of proportions, you could implement methods such as the ratio of proportions, odds ratio, risk ratio, or other suitable measures.
- **Time-to-Event outcomes**: Instead of the default Logrank test, you could include scripts for alternative approaches like the Peto-Peto test, which emphasizes early events, or a restricted mean survival time (RMST)-based test, which describes the mean event-free survival time up to a pre-selected time point.

# Availability

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Explore

You can set up an analysis function in East Horizon Explore under **Test** or **Test Statistic** in a **Design Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Test** field in the **Design Card**. 
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshots below:

For Time-to-event outcomes, the option is available under **General** in the **Test Statistic** field.

## In East

You can set up an enrollment function in East by navigating to the **Compute Test Statistic** task of the **User Defined R Function** tab of a **Simulation Input** window, after including the option.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Choose the appropriate test in the **Design** tab.
1. If you see the **Design Input** window, compute the scenario using the **Compute** button, save the design using the **Save in Workbook** button, then navigate to the **Simulation Input** window by clicking on the **Simulate Design** button under **Library**.
1. Click on the **Include Options** button on the top right corner of the **Simulation Input** window and select both **Accrual / Dropouts** and **User Defined R Function**.
1. In the tab **User Defined R Function**, a list of tasks will appear. Place your cursor in the **File Name** field for the task **Compute Test Statistic**.
1. Click on the button **Browse...** to select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Specify the function name you want to initialize. To copy the function's name from the R script, click on the button **View**.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using the button **Add/Edit Variables**.
1. Continue setting up your project.
