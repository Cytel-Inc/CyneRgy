# Description

The Treatment Selection integration point allows you to customize the selection of arms to carry forward after an interim analysis using a custom R script. Instead of relying on the limited settings (rules) of East or East Horizon, such as selecting a fixed number of top treatments or applying a threshold, you can implement entirely alternative methods to better suit your trial's requirements. For example, you could use Bayesian rules.

# Minimal Template

Your R script could contain a function such as this one, with a name of your choice. All input variables must be declared, even if they are not used in the script. We recommend always declaring `UserParam` as a default `NULL` value in the function arguments, as this will ensure that the same function will work regardless of whether the user has specified any custom parameters in the interface.

```
SelectTreatment <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
  nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
  
  # Example
  vSelectedTreatments 	<- c( 1, 2 )  # Experimental 1 and 2 are carried forward
  vAllocationRatio      <- c( 1, 2 )  # Experimental 2 will receive twice as many as exp 1 or control
  
  # Write the actual code here.
  # Store the selected treatments in a vector called vSelectedTreatments.
  # Store the allocation ratios in a vector called vAllocationRatio.

  return( list( TreatmentID = as.integer( vSelectedTreatments ),
                AllocRatio = as.double( vAllocationRatio ),
                ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```
