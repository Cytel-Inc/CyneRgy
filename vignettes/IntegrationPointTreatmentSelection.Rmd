# Description

The Treatment Selection integration point allows you to customize the selection of arms to carry forward after an interim analysis using a custom R script. Instead of relying on the limited settings (rules) of East or East Horizon, such as selecting a fixed number of top treatments or applying a threshold, you can implement entirely alternative methods to better suit your trial's requirements. For example, you could use Bayesian rules.

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Explore

You can set up a treatment selection function under **Based On** in the **Treatment Selection** tab of a **Design Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**. The statistical design must be **Group Sequential with Treatment Selection**.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. In the **Design Card**, select **Group Sequential with Treatment Selection** under **Statistical Design**.
1. Navigate to the **Treatment Selection** tab.
1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Based On** field.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshot below:

## In East

You can set up a treatment selection function in East by navigating to the **Use R For Treatment Selection** setting of the **Treatment Selection** tab of a **Simulation Input** window.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Choose the appropriate test in the **Design** tab.

1. A list of tasks will appear. Place your cursor in the **File Name** field for the task **Treatment Selection**.
1. Click on the button **Browse...** to select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Specify the function name you want to initialize. To copy the function's name from the R script, click on the button **View**.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using the button **Add/Edit Variables**.

# Input Variables

When creating a custom R script, you can optionally use specific variables provided by East Horizon's engine itself. These variables are automatically available and do not need to be set by the user, except for the `UserParam` variable. Refer to the table below for the variables that are available for this integration point, outcome, and study objective.

| **Variable**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**SimData**|Data Frame|Subject data generated in current simulation, one row per subject. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `SimData$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. Refer to the table below for more information.|
|**DesignParam**|List|Input parameters which may be needed to compute test statistic and perform test. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `DesignParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. Refer to the table below for more information.|
|**LookInfo**|List|Input parameters related to multiple looks which may be needed to compute test statistic and perform test. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `LookInfo$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. Refer to the table below for more information.|
| **UserParam**  | List     | Contains all user-defined parameters specified in the East Horizon interface (refer to the [Instructions](#instructions) section). To access these parameters in your R code, use the syntax: `UserParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate parameter name. |

# Expected Output Variable

East Horizon expects an output of a specific type. Refer to the table below for the expected output for this integration point:

| **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List  | A named list containing `TreatmentID`, `AllocRatio`, and `ErrorCode`.                    |

## Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TreatmentID**   | Vector of Integer  | Vector of length equal to the number of selected treatment arms, containing the indices of the treatments, starting from 1 and excluding the control. For example, [1, 2] indicates that treatment arms 1 and 2 are carried forward.|
| **AllocRatio**   | Vector of Numeric  | Vector of length equal to the number of selected treatment arms, containing the allocation ratio for each treatment arm relative to the control arm, with the control arm always having a ratio of 1.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>‚Äì `0`: No error.<br> ‚Äì `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>‚Äì `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

# Minimal Template

Your R script could contain a function such as this one, with a name of your choice. All input variables must be declared, even if they are not used in the script. We recommend always declaring `UserParam` as a default `NULL` value in the function arguments, as this will ensure that the same function will work regardless of whether the user has specified any custom parameters in the interface.

A detailed template with step-by-step explanations is available here: [TreatmentSelection.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Templates/TreatmentSelection.R) 

```
SelectTreatment <- function( SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
  nError        	    <- 0 # Error handling (no error)
  
  # Example
  vSelectedTreatments 	<- c( 1, 2 )  # Experimental 1 and 2 are carried forward
  vAllocationRatio      <- c( 1, 2 )  # Experimental 2 will receive twice as many as exp 1 or control
  
  # Write the actual code here.
  # Store the selected treatments in a vector called vSelectedTreatments.
  # Store the allocation ratios in a vector called vAllocationRatio.

  return( list( TreatmentID = as.integer( vSelectedTreatments ),
                AllocRatio = as.double( vAllocationRatio ),
                ErrorCode = as.integer( nError ) ) )
}
```
