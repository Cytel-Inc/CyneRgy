# Input Variables

When creating a custom R script, you can optionally use specific variables provided by East Horizon's engine itself. These variables are automatically available and do not need to be set by the user, except for the `UserParam` variable. Refer to the table below for the variables that are available for this integration point, outcome, and study objective.

| **Variable**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**SimData**|Data Frame|Subject data generated in current simulation, one row per subject. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `SimData$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**DesignParam**|List|Input parameters which may be needed to compute test statistics and perform tests. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `DesignParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**LookInfo**|List|Input parameters related to multiple looks. Empty when `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`, but still mandatory in the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision`. See below for more information.|
|**AdaptInfo**|List|Input parameters related to sample size re-estimation. See below for more information. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
| **UserParam**  | List     | Contains all user-defined parameters specified in the East Horizon interface (refer to the [Instructions](IntegrationPointAnalysis.html#instructions) section). To access these parameters in your R code, use the syntax: `UserParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate parameter name. |

# Expected Output Variable

East Horizon expects an output of a specific type. Refer to the table below for the expected output for this integration point:

| **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List  | A named list containing `ErrorCode` and one or multiple of the following members: `Decision`, `TestStat`, `AnalysisTime`, `Delta`, `CtrlCompleters`, `TrmtCompleters`, `CtrlPi`, `HR`, `StdError`. See below for more information.|

The output list can take different forms.

## For `Study Objective = Two Arm Confirmatory`

### Option 1 (Decision): Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decision**   | Integer  | Boundary crossing decision:<br>– `0`: No boundary crossed.<br>– `1`: Lower efficacy boundary crossed.<br>– `2`: Upper efficacy boundary crossed.<br>– `3`: Futility boundary crossed (only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`).<br>– `4`: Equivalence boundary crossed (not available in East Horizon Explore).<br>You can use the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision` to get the decision value. See the template below for the correct usage.|
|**AnalysisTime**|Numeric|Optional. Estimate of analysis time. For interim analyses, equivalent to look time; for final analysis, equivalent to study duration.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>– `0`: No error.<br> – `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>– `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

**Note for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`**: When there is no efficacy boundary to be crossed, the return code of `0` stands for futility in the final look. Similarly, when there is no futility boundary to be crossed, the return code of `0` stands for efficacy in the final look. Use the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision` to get decision values in a simple way.

### Option 2 (TestStat): Expected Members of the Output List

| **Members**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TestStat**   | Numeric  | Value of appropriate test statistic on Wald ﴾Z﴿ scale.|
|**Delta**|Numeric|Estimate of Delta. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 2 or 3` (futility boundary scale is Delta or conditional power) or `Promising Zone Scale = Conditional Power - Estimated`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**CtrlCompleters**|Numeric|Number of completers for control arm. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power) and `Conditional power Delta option = Estimated Delta / Estimated HR`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**TrmtCompleters**|Numeric|Number of completers for treatment arm. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power) and `Conditional power Delta option = Estimated Delta / Estimated HR`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**CtrlPi**|Numeric|Proportion for control arm. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power) and `Conditional power Delta option = Estimated Delta / Estimated HR`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**HR**|Numeric|Estimate of the hazard ratio. Required if `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 6` (futility boundary scale is hazard ratio scale). Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential or Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**StdError**|Numeric|Standard error of estimate of Delta.|Required if `Promising Zone Scale = Conditional Power - Estimated`. Only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`.|
|**AnalysisTime**|Numeric|Optional. Estimate of analysis time. For interim analyses, equivalent to look time; for final analysis, equivalent to study duration.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>– `0`: No error.<br> – `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>– `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

**Note for `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`**: As the design does not have any futility boundary, `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy.

**Notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`**:

- If the design does not have any futility boundary, `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy.
- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 0` (futility boundary scale is Z scale), `TestStat` will be used to check for both efficacy and futility. 
- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 2` (futility boundary scale is Delta scale), `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy and `Delta` will be used to check for futility. 
- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 3` (futility boundary scale is conditional power scale) and `Conditional power Delta option = Estimated Delta / Estimated HR`, `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy and `Delta`, `CtrlCompleters`, `TrmtCompleters`, and `CtrlPi` will be used to check for futility.
- If `LookInfo$FutBdryScale = 6` (futility boundary scale is hazard ratio scale), `TestStat` will be used to check for efficacy and `HR` will be used to check for futility.

**Notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential with Sample Size Re-Estimation`**:

See the notes for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential` above for futility and efficacy checks. Then, if `Promising Zone Scale = Conditional Power - Estimated`, `Delta` and `StdError` will be used for sample size re-estimation.

# Minimal Templates

Your R script could contain a function such as these ones, with a name of your choice. All input variables must be declared, even if they are not used in the script. We recommend always declaring `UserParam` as a default `NULL` value in the function arguments, as this will ensure that the same function will work regardless of whether the user has specified any custom parameters in East Horizon. A detailed template with step-by-step explanations is available here: [Analyze.TimeToEvent.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Templates/Analyze.TimeToEvent.R).
