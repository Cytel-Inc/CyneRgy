# Overview

East Horizon supports the customization of trial design simulations by integrating your own R scripts. This feature allows you to leverage R's robust statistical computing capabilities to enhance your simulation designs. This section provides the steps to access the R integration points, input values you can use in your scripts, expected output values, examples and templates. Each integration point provides a set of inputs for use in your R scripts, leaving it up to you to determine if and how they should be utilized.

## Detailed Information on Integration Points

For comprehensive details about each integration point, please refer to the following pages:
