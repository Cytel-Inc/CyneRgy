# Description

The Dropout integration point allows you to customize the behavior of dropouts in a longitudinal study design using a custom R script. Instead of relying on the built-in default distribution, you can implement dropout distributions such as Poisson or Weibull, to better suit your trial's requirements.
  
# Availability

## East Horizon Explore

This integration point is available in East Horizon Explore for the following study objectives and endpoint types:

- **Two Arm Confirmatory**: continuous, continuous with repeated measures, binary, and time-to-event outcomes.
- ***Two Arm Confirmatory**: dual time-to-event/time-to-event, dual time-to-event/binary outcomes.* <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Coming soon</span>
- ***Multiple Arm Confirmatory**: continuous and binary outcomes.* <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Coming soon</span>

## East Horizon Design <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Coming soon</span>

*This integration point will be available in East Horizon Design in the future.*

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Explore

You can set up a dropout function in East Horizon Explore under **Dropout Distribution** in a **Response Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**. For a Time-to-Event outcome or a Continuous outome with Repeated Measures, it will be under **Distribution** in the **Dropout Rate** tab of the **Response Card**. 

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Dropout Distribution** or **Distribution** field in the **Response Card**.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshots below:
