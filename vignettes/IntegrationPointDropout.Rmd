# Description

The Dropout integration point allows you to customize the behavior of dropouts in a longitudinal study design using a custom R script. Instead of relying on the built-in default distribution, you can implement dropout distributions such as Poisson or Weibull, to better suit your trial's requirements.

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Explore

You can set up a dropout function under **Dropout Distribution** in a **Response Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**. For a Time-to-Event outcome or a Continuous outcome with Repeated Measures, it will be under **Distribution** in the **Dropout Rate** tab of the **Response Card**. 

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Dropout Distribution** or **Distribution** field in the **Response Card**.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshots below:

You can set up a dropout function under **Dropout Distribution** in the **Response** section of an **Input Set** created by simulation.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Create and compute a first **analytical design input set**.
1. Navigate to the Results section and **simulate** the analytical design.
1. Navigate to the new **simulation input set** that was created.
1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **Dropout Distribution** field in the **Response** tab.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.

You can set up a dropout function by navigating to the **Generate Dropout Information** task of the **User Defined R Function** tab of a **Simulation Input** window, after including the option.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Choose the appropriate test in the **Design** tab.
1. In the **Design Input** window, click on the **Include Options** button on the top right corner and select **Accrual / Dropouts**.
1. In the **Accrual / Dropouts** tap of the **Design Input** window, input values in the **Response Lag** and **Probability of Dropout** fields. To use a custom R script, these fields cannot be blank.
1. Compute the scenario using the **Compute** button, save the design using the **Save in Workbook** button, then navigate to the **Simulation Input** window by clicking on the **Simulate Design** button under **Library**.
1. Click on the **Include Options** button on the top right corner of the **Simulation Input** window and select both **Accrual / Dropouts** and **User Defined R Function**.
1. In the tab **User Defined R Function**, a list of tasks will appear. Place your cursor in the **File Name** field for the task **Generate Dropout Information**.
1. Click on the button **Browse...** to select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Specify the function name you want to initialize. To copy the function's name from the R script, click on the button **View**.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using the button **Add/Edit Variables**.
1. Continue setting up your project.
