# Description

The Dropout integration point allows you to customize the behavior of dropouts in a longitudinal study design using a custom R script. Instead of relying on the built-in default binomial distribution, you can implement dropout distributions such as Poisson or Weibull, to better suit your trial's requirements.

# How to Use It in East Horizon

You can set up a dropout function in East Horizon Explore under **Dropout Distribution** in a **Response Card** while creating or editing an **Input Set**. Follow these steps:

1. Select "User Specified-R" from the dropdown in the Dropout Distribution field in the Enrollment card.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project by specifying scenarios for patient Response, Enrollments, etc.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshot below:
