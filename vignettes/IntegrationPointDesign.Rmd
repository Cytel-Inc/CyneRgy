# Description

The Design integration point allows you to customize the statistical test for the treatment effect, the multiplicity adjustment method, and the decision rules of Multiple Endpoints designs instead of relying on East Horizon's parameters. This integration point replaces the Analysis and Multiplicity Adjustment integration points for Multiple Endpoints.

# Availability

## East Horizon Design

This integration point is available in East Horizon Design for the following study objectives and endpoint types:

||Time to Event|Binary|Continuous|Continuous with repeated measures|Count|Composite|Dual TTE-TTE|Dual TTE-Binary|
|----------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Two Arm Confirmatory|❌|❌|❌|❌|❌|❌|❌|❌|
|Two Arm Confirmatory - Multiple Endpoints|✅|✅|✅|-|-|-|-|-|

# Instructions

## In East Horizon Design

You can set up a design function under **User Specified Analysis** in the **Design Tab** while creating or editing an **Input Set**.

<details>
<summary>Follow these steps (click to expand/collapse):</summary>

1. Select **User Specified-R** from the dropdown in the **User Specified Analysis** field in the **Design Tab**.
1. Browse and select the appropriate R file (`filename.r`) from your computer, or use the built-in **R Code Assistant** to create one. This file should contain function(s) written to perform various tasks to be used throughout your Project.
1. Choose the appropriate function name. If the expected function is not displaying, then check your R code for errors.
1. Set any required user parameters (variables) as needed for your function using **+ Add Variables**.
1. Continue creating your project by specifying scenarios for patient Response, Enrollments, etc.

For a visual guide of where to find the option, refer to the screenshot below:

# Input Variables

When creating a custom R script, you can optionally use specific variables provided by East Horizon's engine itself. These variables are automatically available and do not need to be set by the user, except for the `UserParam` variable. Refer to the table below for the variables that are available for this integration point, outcome, and study objective.

| **Variable**   | **Type** | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**SimData**|Data Frame|Subject data generated in current simulation, one row per subject. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `SimData$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**AnalysisData**|Data Frame|Subset of patient data available at the current analysis look. Only relevant for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `AnalysisData$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**DesignParam**|List|Input parameters which may be needed to compute test statistics and perform tests. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `DesignParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**LookInfo**|List|Input parameters related to multiple looks. Empty when `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`, but still mandatory in the functions `CyneRgy::GetDecisionString` and `CyneRgy::GetDecision`. See below for more information.|
|**DataSummary**|List|Summary statistics for each endpoint. To access these variables in your R code, use the syntax: `DataSummary$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate variable name. See below for more information.|
|**OutList**|List|List of outputs that was returned in the previous look. Only relevant for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`. Set to `NULL` for the first look. See below in the Output Variable.|
| **UserParam**  | List     | Contains all user-defined parameters specified in the East Horizon interface (refer to the [Instructions](IntegrationPointAnalysis.html#instructions) section). To access these parameters in your R code, use the syntax: `UserParam$NameOfTheVariable`, replacing `NameOfTheVariable` with the appropriate parameter name. |

**Note:** "Endpoint 1" is used as a sample endpoint name. It will be the actual endpoint name as specified by the user.

# Expected Output Variable

East Horizon expects an output of a specific type. Refer to the table below for the expected output for this integration point:

| **Output**     | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Decision**   | Vector of Integer  | Vector of length `DesignParam$NumTreatments`, containing the boundary crossing decision for each treatment arm:<br>– `0`: No boundary crossed.<br>– `1`: Lower efficacy boundary crossed.<br>– `2`: Upper efficacy boundary crossed.<br>– `4`: Futility boundary crossed (only applicable when `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`).|
|**OutList**|List|List of outputs to pass to the next look. Only relevant for `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`. Will be available as input to this function in the next look. See above in the Input Variables.|
| **ErrorCode**   | Integer  | Optional. Can be used to handle errors in your script:<br>– `0`: No error.<br> – `Positive Integer`: Nonfatal error, the current simulation will be aborted, but the next simulation will proceed.<br>– `Negative Integer`: Fatal error, no further simulations will be attempted.                  |

# Minimal Template

Your R script could contain a function such as this one, with a name of your choice. All input variables must be declared, even if they are not used in the script. We recommend always declaring `UserParam` and `OutList` as a default `NULL` value in the function arguments, as this will ensure that the same function will work regardless of whether the user has specified any custom parameters in the interface and whether or not `OutList` is used.

A detailed template with step-by-step explanations is available here: [Design.MEP.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Templates/Design.MEP.R)

## For `Statistical Design = Fixed Sample`

```
GetMEPDecision <- function( SimData, DataSummary, DesignParam, OutList = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
	nError 	= 0 # Error handling (no error)
	
	Decision = list()
    Decision[ EndpointName[[ 1 ]]] = 0 # Initialize decision for endpoint 1
    Decision[ EndpointName[[ 2 ]]] = 0 # Initialize decision for endpoint 2
    
    # Write the actual code here.
    
	return( list( Decision = as.list( Decision ), ErrorCode = as.integer( nError )))
}
```

## For `Statistical Design = Group Sequential`

```
GetMEPDecision <- function( SimData, AnalysisData, DataSummary, LookInfo, DesignParam, OutList = NULL, UserParam = NULL )
{
	nError 	= 0 # Error handling (no error)
	
	Decision = list()
    Decision[ EndpointName[[ 1 ]]] = 0 # Initialize decision for endpoint 1
    Decision[ EndpointName[[ 2 ]]] = 0 # Initialize decision for endpoint 2
    
    OutList = list()
    OutList$OutVal = 0 # This value will be passed to the next look
    
    # Write the actual code here.
    
	return( list( Decision = as.list( Decision ), OutList = as.list( OutList ), ErrorCode = as.integer( nError )))
}
```
