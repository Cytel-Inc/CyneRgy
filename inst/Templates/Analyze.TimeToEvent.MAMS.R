#'     simulations.}
#' }
#' @details Return Decision to apply custom stopping logic, or TestStat, AdjPVal, or RawPVal to let East Horizon
#'   apply its supported multiplicity adjustments and boundaries. Return one value per experimental arm
#'   in treatment-ID order and NA for arms absent at the current look. Delta is required for Delta-scale
#'   futility; HR is required for hazard-ratio-scale futility in time-to-event designs. RawPVal cannot be
#'   used for adjusted-p-value-scale futility. Return TestStat alongside RawPVal when the selected
#'   Dunnett procedure requires it. Use OutList to pass custom state between looks. This template may use
#'   only a subset of the documented design fields.
