#' @title Template: Analyze stratified time-to-event subject outcomes with subpopulations
#'
#' @description Analyze time-to-event subject outcomes. Use this template as a starting point for custom logic.
#'   Preserve the engine-supplied argument names and access named list elements by name. Supply additional
#'   user-defined inputs through UserParam where that argument is supported.
#'
#' @param SimData Data frame of subject-level data for the current simulation, with one row per subject. Access
#'   columns by name, for example `SimData$ArrivalTime`. Columns include the native fields below when applicable,
#'   plus any custom outputs from enrollment, randomization, response, or dropout generation.
#' \describe{
#'   \item{ArrivalTime}{Numeric vector of subject arrival times on the calendar scale, with one element per
#'     subject, in the same order as TreatmentID.}
#'   \item{TreatmentID}{Integer vector of treatment assignments, with one element per subject: 0 = placebo/control,
#'     1 = first experimental arm, 2 = second experimental arm, and so on.}
#'   \item{SurvivalTime}{Numeric vector of generated time-to-event outcomes measured from each subject's
#'     enrollment, with one element per subject.}

#'
#' SimData also contains the subject-level stratification-factor columns named in DesignParam$StratFactors. When
#'   subpopulations are enabled, Decision, TestStat, and HR are named lists with one element for the full
#'   population and each subpopulation, using the population names defined by the design.
