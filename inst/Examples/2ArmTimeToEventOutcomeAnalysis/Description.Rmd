# Two Arm, Time To Event (TTE) Outcome - Analysis Examples

This example demonstrates how to add new analysis functionality into East using an R function.  

For all examples, we assume the trial design consist of control and an experimental treatment. There are 2 Interim Analyses, IA, and a Final Analysis, FA. At the IA, the analysis is performed and, depending on the example, may determine early efficacy or early futility depending on the design.

The examples included here are to provide different approaches for analyzing the data in the trial. 

In the RCode directory of this example you will find the following R files:

1. AnalyzeUsingEastLogrankFormula.R - Contains a function named AnalyzeUsingEastLogrankFormula to demonstrate the R code necessary for this example as described below.
2. AnalyzeUsingSurvivalPackage.R - Contains a function named AnalyzeUsingSurvivalPackage to demonstrate the R code necessary for this example as described below.

## Example 1 - Two Arm TTE Analysis Using a Formula 28.2 in the East manual

To replace the analysis, use the formulas Q.242 and Q.243 in the East manual to compute the statistic.  The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how the analysis and decision making could be modified in a simple approach.  The test statistic is compared to the lower boundary computed and sent by East as an input. This example does NOT include a futility rule. 

## Example 2 - Two Arm TTE Analysis Using survdiff function from the survival package

This example utilizes the survdiff function from survival package to perform the analysis. The chisquare statistic from survdiff is used to compute the logrank statistic that is compared to the lower boundary computed and sent by East as an input.  This example does NOT include a futility rule.
