#' @title Analyze using the prop.test function in base R.
#' @param SimData Data frame which consists of data generated in current simulation.
#' @param DesignParam List of Design and Simulation Parameters required to perform analysis.
#' @param LookInfo List containing Design and Simulation Parameters, which might be required to perform analysis.
#' @param UserParam A list of user defined parameters in East. The default must be NULL.
#'                  If UserParam is supplied, the list must contain the following named elements:
#'                  UserParam$dLowerLimit - A value (0,1) that specifes the lower limit for the confidence interval. 
#'                  UserParam$dUpperLimit - A value (0,1) that specifies the upper limit for the confidence interval.
#'                  UserParam$dConfLevel - A value (0,1) that specifies the confidence level for the prop.test function in base R.
#' @description This example utilizes the prop.test function in base R to perform the analysis. The p-value from prop.test is used to compute the Z statistic that is compared to the upper boundary computed and sent by East as an input.  
#'              This example does NOT include a futility rule. 
#'              
#' @return TestStat A double value of the computed test statistic
#' @return Decision An integer value: Decision = 0 --> No boundary crossed
#'                                    Decision = 1 --> Lower Efficacy Boundary Crossed
#'                                    Decision = 2 --> Upper Efficacy Boundary Crossed
#'                                    Decision = 3 --> Futility Boundary Crossed
#'                                    Decision = 4 --> Equivalence Boundary Crossed
#' @return ErrorCode An integer value:  ErrorCode = 0 --> No Error
#                                       ErrorCode > 0 --> Non fatal error, current simulation is aborted but the next simulations will run
#                                       ErrorCode < 0 --> Fatal error, no further simulation will be attempted

#'@note Helpful Hints:
#'       There is often info that East sends to R that are not shown in a given example.  It can be very helpful to save the input 
#'       objects and then load them into your R session and inspect them.  This can be done with the following R code in your function.
#'
#'       saveRDS( SimData,     "SimData.Rds")
#'       saveRDS( DesignParam, "DesignParam.Rds" )
#'       saveRDS( LookInfo,    "LookInfo.Rds" )
#'
#'       The above code will save each of the input objects to a file so they may be examined within R.
