#'
#' @title Select user-specified number of treatments to advance that have the largest number of responses.
#'
#' @description This function is used for the MAMS design with a binary outcome and will perform treatment
#'   selection at the interim analysis (IA). At the IA, the user-specified number of experimental treatments
#'   (maxSelection) that have the largest number of responses are selected. After the IA, we would like to
#'   randomize based on user specified inputs: 1:highestResponse:nextHighestResponse (control, selected
#'   experimental arm with highest number of responses, selected experimental arm with the second highest number of
#'   responses)

#' @param UserParam Optional named list of user-defined parameters supplied through East Horizon. The default is

#'
#' Example-specific parameters and requirements:
#' If UserParam is supplied, the list must contain the following named elements:
#' \describe{
#' \item{UserParam$QtyOfArmsToSelect}{A value that defines how many treatment arms are chosen to advance.
#'                          Note this number must match the number of user-specified allocation values.
#'                          If this value is not specified, the default is 2.}
#' \item{UserParam$Rank1AllocationRatio}{A value that specifies the allocation to the arm with the highest response
#'                             If this value is not specified, the default is 2.}

#'   response
#'                                 If this value is not specified, the default is 1.}
#'          }
#'
#' @return Named list of supported output elements. Return the fields needed by the chosen analysis or generation
#'   method; additional custom outputs may also be included.
#' \describe{
#'   \item{TreatmentID}{Required integer vector of selected experimental-arm IDs, starting at 1 and excluding
#'     control. Return at least one selected arm.}
#'   \item{AllocRatio}{Required numeric vector of allocation ratios for the selected experimental arms, in the same
#'     order and with the same length as TreatmentID. Control has allocation 1.}
#'   \item{ErrorCode}{Optional integer execution status: 0 = no error; a positive value aborts the current
#'     simulation but allows subsequent simulations to run; a negative value is fatal and stops all further
#'     simulations.}
#' }
#'
#' @details TreatmentID and AllocRatio must have the same nonzero length and matching order. Include only
#'   experimental treatment IDs; do not include 0 for control. The control allocation ratio is always 1.
#'
#' Worked output objects:
#' \preformatted{
#' Example Output Object: Example 1: Assuming the allocation in 2nd part of the trial is 1:2:2 for
#'   Control:Experimental 1:Experimental 2 vSelectedTreatments <- c( 1, 2 ) # Experimental 1 and 2 both have an
#'   allocation ratio of 2. vAllocationRatio <- c( 2, 2 ) nErrorCode <- 0 lReturn <- list( TreatmentID =
#'   vSelectedTreatments, AllocRatio = vAllocationRatio, ErrorCode = nErrorCode ) return( lReturn )
#'
#' Example 2: Assuming the allocation in 2nd part of the trial is 1:1:2 for Control:Experimental 1:Experimental 2
#'   vSelectedTreatments <- c( 1, 2 ) # Experimental 2 will receive twice as many as Experimental 1 or Control.
#'   vAllocationRatio <- c( 1, 2 ) nErrorCode <- 0 lReturn <- list( TreatmentID = vSelectedTreatments, AllocRatio =
