#'@name RandomizationSubjects
#'@author Shubham Lahoti
#'@description : The following function randomly allots the subjects on either of two arms (control and treatment).
#'Steps : 
#' 1) We generate a random number from Uniform(0, 1). Save it as u.
#' 2) Let p = Allocation fraction on Control arm and 1 - p = Allocation fraction on treatment arm.
#' 3) If u <= p then allot the subject to Control arm else allot the subject to treatment arm.
#' 4) Make sure that Total sample size = Sample size on control + Sample size on treatment arm
#' 
#' @return ErrorCode An integer value:  ErrorCode = 0 --> No Error
#                                       ErrorCode > 0 --> Non fatal error, current simulation is aborted but the next simulations will run
#                                       ErrorCode < 0 --> Fatal error, no further simulation will be attempted.

#' @return retval : This is a binary vector defining the treatment ID where 0 = Subject alloted to Control arm, 
#'                                                                          1 = Subject alloted to treatment arm.
