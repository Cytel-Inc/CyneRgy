# Introduction

Once CyneRgy is installed, you can load this example in RStudio with the following commands:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
CyneRgy::RunExample( "RandomizeSubjects" )
```

Running the command above will load the RStudio project in RStudio. 

**RStudio Project File**: [RandomizeSubjects.Rproj](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/RandomizeSubjects/RandomizeSubjects.Rproj)

In the [R directory of this example](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/tree/main/inst/Examples/RandomizeSubjects/R) you will find the following R files:

1. [RandomizationSubjectsUsingUniformDistribution.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/RandomizeSubjects/R/RandomizationSubjectsUsingUniformDistribution.R) - Contains a function named RandomizationSubjectsUsingUniformDistribution to demonstrate the R code necessary for Example 1 as described below.

2. [RandomizationSubjectsUsingSampleFunctionInR.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/RandomizeSubjects/R/RandomizationSubjectsUsingSampleFunctionInR.R) - Contains a function named RandomizationSubjectsUsingSampleFunctionInR to demonstrate the R code necessary for Example 2 as described below.

3. [BlockRandomizationSubjectsUsingRPackage.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/RandomizeSubjects/R/BlockRandomizationSubjectsUsingRPackage.R) - Contains a function named BlockRandomizationSubjectsUsingRPackage to demonstrate the R code necessary for Example 3 as described below.

4. [LoadrandomizeR.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/RandomizeSubjects/R/LoadRandomizeR.R) - This file is used to install the "randomizeR" package for execution of Block Randomization in R.

# Example 1 - Randomize Subjects Usings Uniform Distribution

The R function named "RandomizationSubjectsUsingUniformDistribution" in the file randomly allots the subjects to either of two arms using Uniform Distribution.

Steps:

- We generate a random number from Uniform(0, 1). Save it as u.
- Let p = Allocation fraction on control arm and 1 - p = Allocation fraction on treatment arm.
- If u <= p then allot the subject to the control arm else allot the subject to treatment arm.
- Make sure that Total sample size = Sample size on control + Sample size on treatment arm.

# Example 2 - Randomize Subjects Using Sample Function

The R function named "RandomizationSubjectsUsingSampleFunctionInR" in the file makes use of Sample() function in R to randomly allot the patients on control and treatment arm.

Steps:

- Let p = Allocation fraction on control arm and 1 - p = Allocation fraction on treatment arm.
- Compute Expected Sample size (rounded) for control and treatment arms using Allocation Fraction and Total sample size.
- Randomly allot the indices to the control and treatment arms using the sample() function available in R.
- Create a vector of zeroes of size = NumSub (Number of subjects) and then replace the zeroes by 1 for the Indices that correspond to treatment. 

# Example 3 - Randomize Subjects Using randomizeR Package

The function named "BlockRandomizationSubjectsUsingRPackage.R" in the file makes use of pbrPar() function from the "randomizeR" library to perform the Block randomization.

Description: 

Imbalances between groups can be minimized in small sampleâ€“size studies by restricting the randomization procedure. Restricted randomization means applying randomization in a manner that helps ensure the desired proportions of treatment groups, beyond random chance, within defined groups of patients.

The permuted block technique randomizes patients into groups within a set of study participants, called a block. 
Treatment assignments within blocks are determined so that they are random in order but that the desired allocation proportions are achieved exactly within each block.
