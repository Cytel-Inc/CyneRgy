# Introduction
The following example demonstrates the integration capabilities of PK/PD modeling into East Horizon using R functions. In the example, we are performing a two arm trial, including a control arm and an experimental treatment arm. In our function, we are utilizing a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination to output the plasma concentration.
