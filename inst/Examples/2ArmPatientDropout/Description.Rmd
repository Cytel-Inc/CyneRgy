## Introduction

For all examples, we assume the trial design consist of control and an experimental treatment. Patients may dropout of a trial for a variety of reasons such as safety issues, treatment burden or other non-trial related issues. The dropout rate can be as high as 30% in some trials if the drug has adverse side effects. The introduction of dropout probabilities or dropout hazard rate plays a significant role during data generation that can be further utilized during the analysis.

Once CyneRgy is installed, you can load this example in RStudio with the following commands:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
CyneRgy::RunExample( "2ArmPatientDropout" )
```

Running the command above will load the RStudio project in RStudio. 

**RStudio Project File**: [2ArmPatientDropout.Rproj](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/2ArmPatientDropout/2ArmPatientDropout.Rproj)


In the [RCode directory of this example](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/tree/main/inst/Examples/2ArmPatientDropout/RCode) you will find the following R files:

1. [GenerateCensoringUsingBinomialProportion.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/2ArmPatientDropout/RCode/GenerateCensoringUsingBinomialProportion.R)

The R function named "GenerateCensoringUsingBinomialProportion" in the file  generates the censor ID using the same dropout probability for both treatment using rbinom(). In this case, the Dropout probability is a common value across both treatments. 

Steps : 

- Let pd = Dropout probability.
- Draw a random sample from Bernoulli distribution with p = 1 - pd, i.e., Binomial(1, pd) of a size n = NumSub.
- The sample generated in step (2) is a censoring indicator where 1 is a patient that does NOT drop out, e.g., completer, and 0 for a patient that drops out, e.g., non-completer.  

2. [GenerateDropoutTimeForSurvival.R](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/blob/main/inst/Examples/2ArmPatientDropout/RCode/GenerateDropoutTimeForSurvival.R)

The function named "GenDropoutTimeForSurvival" generates dropout time for 2-arm survival design. 
In this cases, there is an option to provide a dropout information for each arm which then is utilized to generate dropout times for each arm from Exponential distribution. We fix Number of periods = 1 and Dropout distribution = Exponential.
