#' @param SimulatePatientOutcomeMultiArmPercentAtZero.Binary
#' @title Simulate patient binary outcomes from a binary distribution with a specified percent of treatment-resistant patients for multi-arm trials
#' @param NumSub Integer. The number of subjects to be simulated.
#' @param NumArm Integer. The number of arms in the trial, including the placebo/control.
#' @param TreatmentID A vector specifying the arm index for each subject. The index for the placebo/control arm is 0.
#' @param PropResp A vector of expected proportions of response for each arm
#' @param UserParam A list of user defined parameters in East Horizon. The default must be NULL resulting in ignoring the percent of patients at 0.
#' If UserParam is supplied, the list must contain the following named elements:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentResistantCtrl}{A value in (0, 1) that defines the probability a patient is treatment resistant on the control arm.}
#'    \item{UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentResistantExp1}{A value in (0, 1) that defines the probability a patient is treatment resistant on the experimental arm 1.}
#'    \item{UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentResistantExp2}{A value in (0, 1) that defines the probability a patient is treatment resistant on the experimental arm 2.}
#' }
#' @return The function must return a list in the return statement of the function. The information below lists 
#'             elements of the list, if the element is required or optional and a description of the return values if needed. 
#'             \describe{
#'             \item{Response}{Required numeric value. Contains a vector of generated binary response for all subjects.}
#'             \item{ErrorCode}{Optional integer value \describe{ 
#'                                     \item{ErrorCode = 0}{No Error}
#'                                     \item{ErrorCode > 0}{Nonfatal error, current simulation is aborted but the next simulations will run}
#'                                     \item{ErrorCode < 0}{Fatal error, no further simulation will be attempted}

#' @description
#' In this example, the binary outcome is a patient's response to treatments (0 non-response  or 1 response).   
#' For this function, a percent of patients are believed to be treatment resistant,
#' meaning the patient will not respond to any treatment and their outcome is always a 0.  
#' 
#' The steps to simulating patient data in this example follows a two-step procedure.  
#'  Step 1: Determine if the patient is treatment resistant by simulating a binary variable with the probability of success defined by UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentResistantCtrl, 
#'  UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentResistantExp1 or UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentResistantExp2
#' Step 2: If the patient is determined to be treatment resistant in Step 1, their outcome is set to 0. Otherwise, their outcome is simulated from
#' a binomial distribution using the response probabilities provided in PropResp.
