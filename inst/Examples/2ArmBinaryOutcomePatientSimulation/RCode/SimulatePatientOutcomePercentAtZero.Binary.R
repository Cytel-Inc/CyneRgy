#' @param SimulatePatientOutcomePercentAtZero.Binary
#' @title Simulate patient outcomes from a binary distribution with a percent of patients are treatment resistant. 
#' @param NumSub The number of subjects that need to be simulated, integer value
#' @param NumArm The number of arms in the trial including experimental and control, integer value
#' @param TreatmentID A vector of treatment ids, 0 = treatment 1, 1 = Treatment 2. length( TreatmentID ) = NumSub
#' @param PropResp A vector of expected proportions of response for each arm
#' @param  UserParam A list of user defined parameters in East.   The default must be NULL resulting in simulating from a non-mixture distribution.
#' If UserParam is supplied, the list must contain the following named elements:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentReistantCtrl}{A value in (0, 1) that defines the probability a patient is treatment resistant the control (ctrl) treatment.}
#'    \item{UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentReistantExp}{A value in (0, 1) that defines the probability a patient is treatment resistant experimental (exp) treatment.}
#' }
#' @description
#' In this example, the binary outcome is a patient's response to treatment (0 non-response  or 1 response).   
#' For this function, a percent of patients are believed to be treatment resistant,
#' meaning the patient will not respond to any treatment and their outcome is always a 0.  
#' 
#' The steps to simulating patient data in this example follows a two-step procedure.  
#'  Step 1: Determine if the patient is treatment resistant by simulating a binary variable with the probability of success defined by UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentReistantCtrl or 
#'  UserParam$dProbOfTreatmentReistantExp
#'  Step 2: If the value in Step 1, indicating the patient is treatment resistant then their outcome is set to 0, otherwise the simulate their
#'  outcome from a binomial distribution using the response probabilities provided in PropRest.
