#' Simulate patient outcomes from a Weibull distribution 
#' @param NumSub The number of subjects that need to be simulated, integer value. NumSub survival times need to be generated for the trial.  
#'           This is a single numeric value, eg 250.
#' @param NumArm - The number of arms in the trial, a single numeric value.  For a two arm trial, this will be 2. 
#' @param TreatmentID A vector of treatment ids, 0 = treatment 1, 1 = Treatment 2. length( TreatmentID ) = NumSub
#' @param SurvMethod If SurvMethod is 1 (Hazard Rates):
#'   SurvParam is an array that specifies arm by arm hazard rates (one rate per arm per piece). Thus SurvParam [i, j] specifies hazard rate in ith period for jth arm.
#'   Arms are in columns with column 1 is control, column 2 is experimental
#'   Time periods are in rows
#'   If SurvMethod is 2:
#'         SurvParam is an array specifies arm by arm the Cum % Survivals (one value per arm per piece). Thus, SurvParam [i, j] specifies Cum % Survivals in ith period for jth arm.
#'   If SurvMethod is 3:
#'         SurvParam will be a 1 x 2 array with median survival times on each arms. Column 1 is control, column 2 is experimental 
#' @param NumPrd The number of periods in the East input.
#' @param PrdTime TODO - Get this from East
#' @param SurvParam - Depends on the table in the Response Generation tab. 2‚ÄêD array of parameters uses to generate time of events.
#' @param UserParam A list of user defined parameters in East. The default must be NULL.
#'  If UserParam is supplied, TODO What parameter are we sending and what are we using:
#'  \describe{
#'       \item{UserParam$dShapeCtrl}{The shape parameter in the Weibull distribution for the control treatment}  
#'       \item{UserParam$dScaleCtrl}{The scale parameter in the Weibull distribution for the control treatment}
#'       \item{UserParam$dShapeExp}{The shape parameter in the Weibull distribution for the experimental treatment}  
#'       \item{UserParam$dScaleExp}{The scale parameter in the Weibull distribution for the experimental treatment}
#'  }
#'  @description
#'  This function simulates patient data from a Weibull( shape, scale ) distribution.   The rweibull function in the stats package
#'  is used to simulate the survival time.  See help on rweibull.  
#'  The required function signature for integration with East includes the SurvMethod, NumPrd, PrdTime and SurvParam which are ignored in this function
#'  and only the parameters in UserParam are utilized.
