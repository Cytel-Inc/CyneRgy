# Version 2
# Parameter Description 
# NumSub - The number of patients (subjects) in the trial.  NumSub survival times need to be generated for the trial.  
#           This is a single numeric value, eg 250.
# NumArm - The number of arms in the trial, a single numeric value.  For a two arm trial, this will be 2. 
# The SurvParam depends on input in East. In the simulation window on the Response Generation tab 
# SurvMethod - This values is pulled from the Input Method drop-down list.  
# SurvParam - Depends on the table in the Response Generation tab. 2‚ÄêD array of parameters usds to generate time of events.
# If SurvMethod is 1:
#   SurvParam is an array that specifies arm by arm hazard rates (one rate per arm per piece). Thus SurvParam [i, j] specifies hazard rate in ith period for jth arm.
#   Arms are in columns with column 1 is control, column 2 is experimental
#   Time periods are in rows
# If SurvMethod is 2:
#   SurvParam is an array specifies arm by arm the Cum % Survivals (one value per arm per piece). Thus, SurvParam [i, j] specifies Cum % Survivals in ith period for jth arm.
# If SurvMethod is 3:
#   SurvParam will be a 1 x 2 array with median survival times on each arms. Column 1 is control, column 2 is experimental 
#  
# Description: This function simulates from exponential, just included as a simple example as a starting point
