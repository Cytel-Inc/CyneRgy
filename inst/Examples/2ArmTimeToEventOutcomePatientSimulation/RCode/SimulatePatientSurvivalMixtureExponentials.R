#'  @description
#'  This function simulates patient data from a mixture of Exponential distributions. The mixture is based on patient subgroups.  For each,
#'  subgroup you specify the median time-to-event for the control and experimental treatments as well as the probability a patient belongs in a specific group.
#'  The required function signature for integration with East includes the SurvMethod, NumPrd, PrdTime and SurvParam which are ignored in this function
#'  and only the parameters in UserParam are utilized.
