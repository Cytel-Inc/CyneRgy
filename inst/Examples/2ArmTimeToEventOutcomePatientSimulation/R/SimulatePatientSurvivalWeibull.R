#'  @description
#'  This function simulates patient data from a Weibull( shape, scale ) distribution. The rweibull function in the stats package
#'  is used to simulate the survival time. See help on rweibull.  
#'  The required function signature for integration with East includes the SurvMethod, NumPrd, PrdTime and SurvParam which are ignored in this function
#'  and only the parameters in UserParam are utilized.
