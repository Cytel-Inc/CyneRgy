# Two Arm, Time-To-Event Outcome - Patient Outcome Simulation Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to add new patient outcome simulation capabilities into East using an R function in the context of a two-arm trial with a time-to-event patient outcome. For all examples, we assume the trial design consists of standard of care and an experimental treatment and the trial design assumes patient outcomes are normally distributed.

**East Workbook**: 2ArmTimeToEventOutcomePatientSimulation.cywx

**R Studio Project File**: 2ArmTimeToEventOutcomePatientSimulation.Rproj.

In the RCode directory of this example you will find the following R files:

1.  SimulatePatientSurvivalWeibull.R - This file provides an example R function to simulate patient time-to-event data from a Weibull distribution.  

2. SimulatePatientSurvivalMixtureExponential.R - This file provides an example R function to simulate patient data from a mixture of exponential distributions.  The mixture is based on having any number of patient groups in the study where each group has a different Exponential distribution for simulating the time-to-event from. 

In addition, if you would like to experiment with these examples to and would like some code to help you get started, we have provided fill-in-the-blank type code files in the FillInTheBlankRCode directory.  

## Example 1 - Simulation of Patient Time-To-Event Data from a Weibull Distribution

To replace the patient outcome simulation.. 

## Example 2 - Simulation of Patient Time-To-Event Data from a Mixture of Distributions
Simulate patient data from a mixture of exponential distributions.  The mixture is based on having any number of patient groups in the study where each group has a different Exponential distribution for simulating the time-to-event from.
