# Introduction
#This code can generate and analyze patient data for a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM).
#It shows the ability of East Horizon using R integration.
#MMRM is a statistical model used for longitudinal continuous outcomes in clinical trials.
#This code is currently intended to work for 2-arm studies.
#The example code uses a Schizophrenia study by:
#Comparing the difference in PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) scores of control vs treatment groups of patients with Schizophrenia. Patients were treated for 7 weeks (1 week screening, 4 weeks of treatment, and a follow-up after 2 weeks).
