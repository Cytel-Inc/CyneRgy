# Introduction :
Repeated measures involve collecting multiple data points for the same variable from the same subjects across multiple time periods. This method provides insights into the subjects' development and changes over time. In this context, a single subject can have multiple responses over time, and these responses can be correlated across different visits.

For a Normal endpoint in repeated measures, the generation of responses primarily depends on the mean and standard deviation across all visits, as well as the correlation between these visits.

In the R Code directory of this example you will find the following R files:

1. GenerateResponseDiffOfMeansRepeatedMeasures.R

The R function named "GenRespDiffOfMeansRepMeasures" in the file  is used to generate the Normal responses across multiple visits for 2 arm Normal Repeated measures design.


2. LibraryMASS.R

This file is used to load the library "MASS" to run mvrnorm() function.
