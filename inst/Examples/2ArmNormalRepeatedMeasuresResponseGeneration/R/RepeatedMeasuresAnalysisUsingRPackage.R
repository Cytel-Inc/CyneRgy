#' @details This fixed-sample example assumes a common treatment effect across all post-baseline visits and
#'   returns its signed normal-equivalent statistic, computed from the model's two-sided t-test p-value.
#'   It does not estimate the configured visit-specific primary and secondary
#'   contrasts. Extend the model before returning PrimDelta or SecDelta. A non-NULL LookInfo is unsupported and
#'   returns ErrorCode = 1.
#'
#' For ordinary analysis designs, return either Decision to apply custom stopping logic or TestStat to let
#'   the engine apply its boundaries. Delta, event/completer counts, and standard errors may also be required for
#'   Delta-scale or conditional-power futility. Sample size re-estimation designs require a decision and the
#'   re-estimated total event/completer count. This example may use only a subset of the documented design fields.
