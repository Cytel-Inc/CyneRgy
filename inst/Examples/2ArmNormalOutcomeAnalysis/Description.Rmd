# Introduction
# Two Arm, Normal Outcome - Analysis Examples

This example demonstrates how to add new analysis functionality  into East using an R function.  

For all examples, we assume the trial design consist of control and an experimental treatment. There are 2 Interim Analyses, IA, and a Final Analysis, FA. At the IA, the analysis is performed and, depending on the example, may determine early efficacy or early futility depending on the design.

The examples included here are to provide different approaches for analyzing the data in the trial. 

In the RCode directory of this example you will find the following R files:

1.  AnalyzeUsingEastManualFormulaNormal.R - Contains a function named AnalyzeUsingEastManualFormulaNormal to demonstrate the R code necessary for this example as described below.

2.  AnalyzeUsingTTestNormal.R - Contains a function named AnalyzeUsingTTestNormal to demonstrate the R code necessary for this example as described below.



## Example 1 - Two-arm Arm Normal Analysis Using a Formula Q.3.3 in the East manual

To replace the analysis, use the formula Q.3.3 in the East manual to compute the statistic.  The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how the analysis and decision making could be modified in a simple approach.  The test statistic is compared to the upper boundary computed and sent by East as an input. This example does NOT include a futility rule. 

## Example 2 - Two-arm Arm Normal Analysis Using the t.test function in R  

This example utilizes the t.test() function in base R to perform the analysis. The t statistic that is compared to the upper boundary computed and sent by East as an input.  This example does NOT include a futility rule.
