# Getting Started

## Overview

Cytel’s products such as East Horizon support the customization of trial
design simulations by integrating your own R scripts. This feature
allows you to leverage R’s robust statistical computing capabilities to
enhance your simulation designs. This section provides the steps to
access the R integration points, input values you can use in your
scripts, expected output values, examples and templates. Each
integration point provides a set of inputs for use in your R scripts,
leaving it up to you to determine if and how they should be utilized.
