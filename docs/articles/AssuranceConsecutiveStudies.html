</h2>
<p>The intent of this example is to demonstrate the computation of
Bayesian assurance, or probability of success, through the integration
of R with <a href="Cytel">http://Cytel.com</a> products using a series
of examples. These examples begin with a 2-arm, normal outcome, fixed
sample trial assuming a non-standard prior for computation of assurance.
The examples progress to a more complex setting of computing assurance
for a sequence of a phase 2 trial with normal outcomes followed by a
phase 3 trial where the outcome is time-to-event.</p>
<p>The examples will all contain two treatments, Standard of Care (S)
and Experimental (E) and are follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Fixed sample design using a mixture of normal distributions for
computation of assurance</li>
<li>Expand example 1 to a group sequential design with an interim for
futility based on a Bayesian predictive probability</li>
<li>Fixed design with a time-event-event outcome, this example provides
the basis and a comparison for the phase 2 followed by a phase 3 example
considered last</li>
<li>Two consecutive studies, phase 2 with a normal endpoint followed by
a phase 3 with a normal endpoint</li>
<li>Two consecutive studies, phase 2 with a normal endpoint followed by
a phase 3 with a time-to-event outcome</li>

<p>Fixed sample, with normally distributed outcomes Y.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample size: 80 patients per arm</li>
<li>Assume standard deviation is known: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 1.9\)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Denote the minimum acceptable value by MAV. For patients receiving
treatment <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> = S or E, we assume the
outcomes Y <span class="math inline">\(\sim N( \mu_j, \sigma^2)\)</span>
where, for simplicity, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span> is
unknown and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the known,
fixed quantity. We assume <em>a priori</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j \sim\)</span> Normal( <span class="math inline">\(\theta_j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_j^2\)</span>= <span class="math inline">\(1000^2\)</span> ), for <span class="math inline">\(j=\)</span> S or E. At the end of the study the
following is computed:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    \rho = Pr( \mu_E &gt; \mu_S + MAV | data ) \text{ and}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[  
    \text{If } \rho &gt; P_U \implies \text{ Go }\\
    \text{ If } \rho \leq P_U \implies \text{ No Go }
\]</span> For decision making we assume <span class="math inline">\(P_U
= 0.8\)</span>. For assurance, a mixture of normal distributions is
assumed. The assurance prior is specified in terms of the prior weight,
mean, and variance for each component of the mixture. For simplicity, we
assume mixture of two normal distributions as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight: 25% on <span class="math inline">\(N( 0, 0.05
)\)</span>
</li>
<li>Weight: 75% on <span class="math inline">\(N( 0.7,
0.3^2)\)</span>
</li>

<p>In order to evaluate the design above, one can develop an R function
for analysis that can be called from East during simulation. By
replacing only the analysis function with an R function, one can obtain
the frequentist operating characteristics of the Bayesian design using
East. In addition, by replacing how the patient data is simulated one
can obtain the Bayesian assurance. Specifically, in the simulation when
the patient data is simulated an R function will first sample the
assurance prior then sample the patient data. The resulting power of
this simulation will be the Bayesian assurance assuming the 2 component
prior given above.</p>
<p>There is often a need for examination of posterior distribution of
both observed and true treatment differences given a Go decision. These
posterior distributions can be useful for planning the next phase of
study and understanding potential risks. Obtaining the posterior
distributions is described in the next section and they are applied to
the phase 2 followed by phase 3 in later sections.</p>

<p>The two functions that are needed to evaluate this design and obtain
the Bayesian assurance are the analysis function,
AnayzeUsingBayesianNormals, and patient simulation function,
SimulatePatientOutcomeNormalAssurance.</p>
<p>To help understand the AnayzeUsingBayesianNormals one must first
derive the posterior distributions.</p>
<p>After observing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> patients on
treatment <span class="math inline">\(j =\)</span> S or E, the posterior
distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_j\)</span> is:</p>

\theta_j^* = \frac{\frac{\theta_j}{\tau_j^2} +

<p>Using the East workbook named Assurance.cywx with East version <span class="math inline">\(&gt;=\)</span> 6.5.4 the Example 1 simulation can
be used to obtain the results found in the next section. After editing
the simulation, on the User Define R Functions the Generate Response and
Compute Test Statistic are both replaced with R code. The Generate
Response utilizes the SimulatePatientOutcomeNormalAssurance found in the

<p>Same study design as previous example, however, this design includes
an interim analysis to check for futility when 50% of the patients have
their outcome observed. The futility rule is based on a Bayesian
predictive probability of a No Go at the end of the study. That is, at
the interim analysis if it is likely that the study will make a No Go
decision at the final analysis, then the study is stopped early for
futility.</p>
<p>Denote the data at the interim analysis by <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> and data for patients enrolled after
the IA by <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>. If the predictive
probability of a No Go at the final analysis is greater than <span class="math inline">\(PU_{Futility} = 90\)</span>% then the trial is
stopped for futility. Specifically, if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    Pr( \text{End of Study No Go} | X_1 ) &gt; PU_{Futility} = 90\%

becomes <span class="math display">\[

<p>This study is a two-arm fixed sample size design with a time-to-event
endpoint. Total sample size is 600 patients with 300 patients per arm.
There is a single analysis when 50% of the patients have had their event
observed. A hazard ratio (HR) below 1 is considered to favor the
experimental arm. The analysis is assumed to be a cox proportional
hazard model where a Go decision is made if the p-value <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> 0.025.</p>
<p>For assurance, a bi-modal prior on the Log(HR) is used. The

<p>In this section we explore computing assurance and conditional
assurance for two consecutive studies. A phase 2 with normal endpoints
(similar setup to Example 1) followed by a Phase 3 with a normal
endpoint.</p>
<p>The goal is to understand how much the phase 3 trial can be de-risked
by first running a phase 2 study to gather additional information.
De-risking is determined by comparing the probability of a No Go in a
phase 3 if the phase 2 was skipped versus the probability of a No Go in
phase 3 if the phase 2 was first conducted and successful. Specifically,
we compute the assurance of the phase 3 conditional on a Go decision in
phase 2.</p>

</h3>
<p>This study is a two-arm fixed sample size design with a time-to-event
endpoint. Total sample size is 600 patients with 300 patients per arm.
There is a single analysis when 50% of the patients have had their event
observed. A hazard ratio (HR) below 1 is considered to favor the
experimental arm. The analysis is assumed to be a cox proportional
hazard model where a Go decision is made if the p-value <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> 0.025.</p>
<p>The relationship between the continuous endpoint in phase 2 and the
time-to-event endpoint in phase 3 is assumed to follow a linear
function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
log(\ True \ HR\ ) \text{ in phase 3 = 0.1 âˆ’ 0.4 âˆ— ( true treatment
difference in phase  2)}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the relationship is established on the true treatment
effects. Since the phase 2 provides a prior on the true treatment
different and we have the linear link function between the true
treatment difference and the true HR, we do not need to specify the
prior on the true HR like in Example 3.</p>

<h3 id="east-r-integration">East-R Integration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#east-r-integration"></a>
</h3>
<p>For this example, in the East workbook Example 5 - Phase 2 is used to
simulate the phase 2 and Example 5 - Phase 3 is used to simulate the
phase 3 for both the conditional and unconditional assurance
calculations. When the phase 2 is simulated, the true treatment
different is sampled from the prior is saved in the output file from
phase 2. Both the conditional and unconditional phase 3 use an R
initialize function to read in the output from the phase 2 and obtain
the true treatment difference which is then converted to the log of the
true HR given the link function above. Note, for the unconditional
assurance an alternative approach would be to sample the phase 2 prior
directly rather then read the output from phase 2. However, reading the
true values in from the phase 2 creates a more consistent comparison
between the conditional and unconditional assurance calculations and a
more accurate estimate of the benefit of running the phase 2 prior to
the phase 3.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="required-r-function">Required R Function<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#required-r-function"></a>
</h4>
<p>For the phase 2, the same functions are needed as Example 2.</p>
<p>The two functions that are needed to evaluate this design and obtain
the Bayesian assurance are the analysis function,
AnayzeUsingBayesianNormals, and patient simulation function,
SimulatePatientOutcomeNormalAssurance.</p>
<p>For the phase 3, three functions are needed: 1)
ReadExample5Phase2Output, 2) AnalyzeSurvivalDataUsingCoxPh, and 3)
SimulatePatientSurvivalAssuranceUsingPh2Pior and the functions are
located in the R directory in the file with the matching file name. The
ReadExample5Phase2Output is called from the Initialize R Environment in
East and loads the survival package as it is needed for the coxph
function and also reads in the true treatment difference from phase 2.
Note the use of the &lt;&lt;- operator to create a global variables
vPrior, the vector with the treatment difference, and nSimIndex to keep
track of which simulation index or replication the simulation is
executing when the call to SimulatePatientSurvivalAssuranceUsingPh2Pior
is executed. Both vPrior and nSimIndex are utilized in the function
SimulatePatientSurvivalAssuranceUsingPh2Pior and the nSimIndex variable
is updated with each call.</p>
<p>The function ReadExample5Phase2Output utilizes the UserParam
variables from East and if UserParam$bConditionalOnGo is 1, then only
the true treatment effects that resulted in a Go decision in Phase 2 are
retained allowing the simulation to compute the conditional assurance.
Note that the number of replications used in simulating the phase 3 for
conditional assurance must be less than or equal to the number of
simulated phase 2 trials that were successful. If
UserParam$bConditionalOnGo is 0 then all true treatment effects sampled
in the Phase 2 are retained allowing the simulation to compute the
unconditional assurance.</p>
