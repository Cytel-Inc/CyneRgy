# CyneRgy
R integration with Cytel products provides a highly efficient approach to achieving custom adaptive clinical trial designs, without requiring the user to develop an entire R Code base. CyneRgy is an R package to illustrate the synergy of using R and Cytel products for clinical trial simulation and provide the users with tools to help develop new functions.  


# Introduction 

This repository and corresponding website provides an overview of the R examples provided in this repository.  Each example is intended to be used with one of Cytel's products (East or Solara).  Each example is included in a directory that provides an R Studio project file, a Description file that describes the example,  RCode folder which contains the example R scripts, FillInTheBlinakRCode are the worked examples with various code deleted so the user can practice and fill in the blanks. 

In addition, the CyneRgy package provide helpful function for the user to create their own R functions based on templates and a seamless R experience for viewing example in R Studio.   

In addition, the Sandbox directory contains in progress examples that are not complete.  Please be advised that the examples in this directory have not been completed or tested. 

# Examples 
A variety of example can be fond in this package.   Please see [Examples](articles/ExampleOutline.html) for a complete list of examples.  The CyneRgy package provides many built in functions that may be utilized, for a complete list see [References](reference/index.html)   

# Installation

# Package Development

This document is intended to help with development of this package.  In this document you can find packages that are helpful, example code snippets and functions calls that were made to create new functions. 

## Style Guide 

 Please follow the [Biopharm Soft style guide](https://biopharmsoftgrp.github.io/BioPharmSoftRStyleGuide/) when developing code so that the style is consistent across different developers.

## Helpful Code Snippets
If you need help please ask Kyle Wathen or another team member

Add code snippet by Clicking Tools-> Global Options -> Code-> Edit Snippets.  In the Snippets menu choose R.  When creating new snippets the key work snippet should start in column 1 and the snippets should be indented.  In order to insert a snippet in R Studio you type the snippet name, or partial name, and click tab. 


Snippet to insert a new comment (newcom) will insert a commented code block.

 ```
snippet newcom
    `r paste( paste( rep( "#", 100), collapse="" ), "." )`
    # ${0} ####
     `r paste( paste( rep( "#", 100), collapse="" ), "." )`
```

Snippet to insert a header (header).

```
snippet header
   `r paste( paste( rep( "#", 100), collapse="" ), "." )`
   #   Program/Function Name: ${1}
