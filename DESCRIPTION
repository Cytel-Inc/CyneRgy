Description: R integration with Cytel products provides a highly efficient approach to achieving custom adaptive clinical trial 
 designs, without requiring you to develop an entire R code base. The CyneRgy R package illustrates the synergy of using R and 
 Cytel products for clinical trial simulation and provide tools to help develop new functions.
