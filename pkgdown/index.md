# Introduction 

R integration with Cytel's products provides a highly efficient way to create custom adaptive clinical trial designs and enhance your simulation capabilities, without requiring you to develop an entire R code base.

The CyneRgy R package demonstrates the synergy between R and Cytel's products such as East Horizon, providing tools, documentation, templates, and examples. It also offers a streamlined R experience in RStudio, simplifying the creation of new custom scripts.

# Getting Started

For a quick start, visit the [Getting Started](articles/Overview.html) section. This guide covers the basics of integrating your R scripts with Cytel's products, including detailed steps for accessing integration points, what input variables are available, what output variables are expected, and links to related templates and examples.

# Examples and Templates

A variety of examples highlighting how R scripts can seamlessly integrate with Cytelâ€™s simulation tools can be found in this package. Please see [Examples Outline](articles/ExampleOutline.html) for a complete list of examples and their descriptions. 

[Each example directory](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/tree/main/inst/Examples) provides:

- An **RStudio project file** for setup.  
- A **Description file** detailing the example.  
- An **RCode folder** which contains the example R scripts.  
- A **FillInTheBlankRCode folder** which contains practice scripts with sections removed for hands-on learning.  

Templates are available in the [Templates directory](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/tree/main/inst/Templates), and exploratory, in-progress examples can be found in the [Sandbox directory](https://github.com/Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy/tree/main/Sandbox). Note that Sandbox examples are incomplete and untested.

# Functions

The CyneRgy package also provides many built-in functions to facilitate the creation of your custom R scripts. For a complete list of available functions, see [References](reference/index.html). 

# Installation 

Currently, this package is not officially released and is not available on CRAN. However, it may be installed directly from GitHub using the [remotes package](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) with the following code:

```
remotes::install_github( "Cytel-Inc/CyneRgy@main" )
```

You must have the remotes package to use the above command. To launch the examples, you will also need to have the rstudioapi package.
