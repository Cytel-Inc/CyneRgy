\description{
Function to compute the Bayesian predictive probability of success for a clinical trial using
Bayesian analysis. The function simulates future patient outcomes based on posterior distributions
derived from observed interim data and evaluates the probability of trial success at the end.
}
\details{
This function computes the Bayesian predictive probability of success for a clinical trial.
It uses observed interim data to update the Beta priors into posterior distributions for success probabilities
of both control and experimental treatments. Future patient outcomes are simulated based on these posteriors,
and the trial success is evaluated based on the probability that the experimental treatment has a higher success rate
than the control treatment. The predictive probability is calculated as the proportion of simulated trials
meeting the success criteria.
