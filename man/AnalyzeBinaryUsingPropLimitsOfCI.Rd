}}

\item{UserParam}{A list of user-defined parameters with the following required elements:
\describe{
\item{dLowerLimit}{A value (0,1) specifying the lower limit, e.g., Minimum Acceptable Value (MAV).}
\item{dUpperLimit}{A value (0,1) specifying the upper limit for the confidence interval, e.g., Target Value (TV).}
\item{dConfLevel}{A value (0,1) specifying the confidence level for the \code{prop.test} function.}
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\describe{
\item{TestStat}{A double representing the computed test statistic.}
\item{Decision}{Required integer value indicating the decision made:
\describe{
\item{0}{No boundary crossed (neither efficacy nor futility).}
\item{1}{Lower efficacy boundary crossed.}
\item{2}{Upper efficacy boundary crossed.}
\item{3}{Futility boundary crossed.}
\item{4}{Equivalence boundary crossed.}
}}
\item{ErrorCode}{Optional integer value:
\describe{
\item{0}{No error.}
\item{> 0}{Non-fatal error; current simulation is aborted but subsequent simulations continue.}
\item{< 0}{Fatal error; no further simulations are attempted.}
}}
\item{Delta}{Estimated difference between experimental and control treatments.}
}
}
\description{
This function analyzes binary data using a simplified confidence interval (CI) limits design.
It determines whether to make a "Go" or "No Go" decision based on the treatment difference
and user-specified thresholds for the CI lower and upper limits. The analysis uses the \code{prop.test}
function from base R to compute CIs at a user-defined confidence level.

The decision logic is as follows:
\itemize{
\item If the lower limit (LL) of the CI is greater than \code{UserParam$dLowerLimit}, a "Go" decision is made.
\item If a "Go" decision is not made, and the upper limit (UL) of the CI is less than \code{UserParam$dUpperLimit}, a "No Go" decision is made.
\item Otherwise, continue to the next analysis.
\item At the final analysis:
\itemize{
\item If LL > \code{UserParam$dLowerLimit}, a "Go" decision is made.
\item Otherwise, a "No Go" decision is made.
}
}
}
\note{
In this example, the boundary information computed and sent from East or East Horizon is ignored
to implement this decision approach.
