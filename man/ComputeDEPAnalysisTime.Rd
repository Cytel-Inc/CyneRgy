\title{Compute Analysis Time for Dual Endpoint (DEP) Designs}
\usage{
ComputeDEPAnalysisTime(SimData, DesignParam, LookInfo = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{SimData}{A data frame containing the simulated subject-level data with the following required columns:
\describe{
\item{ClndrRespTime}{Response times for Endpoint 1.}
\item{CensorIndOrg}{Censoring indicators for Endpoint 1.}
\item{ClndrRespTime2}{Response times for Endpoint 2.}
\item{CensorIndOrg2}{Censoring indicators for Endpoint 2.}
}}

\item{DesignParam}{A list of design parameters containing:
\describe{
\item{EndpointType}{Numeric vector specifying endpoint types (1 = completer, 2 = event).}
\item{EndpointName}{Character vector of endpoint names.}
\item{PlanEndTrial}{Integer specifying which endpoint(s) define the trial end:
\describe{
\item{1}{Both endpoints.}
\item{2}{Endpoint 1 only.}
\item{3}{Endpoint 2 only.}
}}
\item{MaxCompleters}{List of target numbers of completers for each endpoint.}
\item{MaxEvents}{List of target numbers of events for each endpoint.}
\item{SampleSize}{Total sample size.}
}}

\item{LookInfo}{Optional list specifying Group Sequential Design information (default = \code{NULL}).
When provided, indicates that a GSD is used and must include:
\describe{
\item{SyncInterim}{Endpoint ID used for interim look positioning.}
\item{NumLooks}{Total number of looks planned.}
\item{CurrLookIndex}{Current look index.}
\item{NumEndpointLooks}{Numeric vector giving the number of looks per endpoint.}
\item{CumEvents}{List of cumulative event targets per endpoint.}
\item{CumCompleters}{List of cumulative completer targets per endpoint.}
}}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the calendar analysis time (in the same units as \code{ClndrRespTime}).
}
\description{
Computes the calendar analysis time for trials with one or two endpoints, supporting both
Fixed Sample Designs and Group Sequential Designs. The function determines when the planned
number of events or completers has been reached based on simulated trial data and design parameters.

For Group Sequential Designs, the analysis time is determined according to the current interim look and
synchronization endpoint. For Fixed Sample Designs, the analysis time corresponds to the final look when
all required events or completers are observed.
