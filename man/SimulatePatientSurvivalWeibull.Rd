\usage{
SimulatePatientSurvivalWeibull(
  NumSub,
  NumArm,
  TreatmentID,
  SurvMethod,
  NumPrd,
  PrdTime,
  SurvParam,
  UserParam = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{NumSub}{The number of subjects that need to be simulated, integer value. NumSub survival times need to be generated for the trial.
This is a single numeric value, eg 250.}

\item{NumArm}{- The number of arms in the trial, a single numeric value.  For a two arm trial, this will be 2.}

\item{TreatmentID}{A vector of treatment ids, 0 = treatment 1, 1 = Treatment 2. length( TreatmentID ) = NumSub}

\item{SurvMethod}{If SurvMethod is 1 (Hazard Rates):
SurvParam is an array that specifies arm by arm hazard rates (one rate per arm per piece). Thus SurvParam [i, j] specifies hazard rate in ith period for jth arm.
Arms are in columns with column 1 is control, column 2 is experimental
Time periods are in rows
If SurvMethod is 2:
      SurvParam is an array specifies arm by arm the Cum % Survivals (one value per arm per piece). Thus, SurvParam [i, j] specifies Cum % Survivals in ith period for jth arm.
If SurvMethod is 3:
      SurvParam will be a 1 x 2 array with median survival times on each arms. Column 1 is control, column 2 is experimental}

\item{NumPrd}{The number of periods in the East input.}

\item{PrdTime}{TODO - Get this from East}

\item{SurvParam}{- Depends on the table in the Response Generation tab. 2‚ÄêD array of parameters uses to generate time of events.}

\item{UserParam}{A list of user defined parameters in East. The default must be NULL.
If UserParam is supplied, 
\describe{
     \item{UserParam$dShapeCtrl}{The shape parameter in the Weibull distribution for the control treatment}  
     \item{UserParam$dScaleCtrl}{The scale parameter in the Weibull distribution for the control treatment}
     \item{UserParam$dShapeExp}{The shape parameter in the Weibull distribution for the experimental treatment}  
     \item{UserParam$dScaleExp}{The scale parameter in the Weibull distribution for the experimental treatment}
}
@description
This function simulates patient data from a Weibull( shape, scale ) distribution.   The rweibull function in the stats package
is used to simulate the survival time.  See help on rweibull.  The exponential with mean = scale is a special case with the shape = 1   
The required function signature for integration with East includes the SurvMethod, NumPrd, PrdTime and SurvParam which are ignored in this function
and only the parameters in UserParam are utilized.
